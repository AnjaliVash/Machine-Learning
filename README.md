A review on Bio-Inspired computing in Finance Management

Bio-inspired evolutionary algorithms are probabilistic search methods that mimic natural biological evolution. They show the behaviour of the biological entities interacting locally with one another or
with their environment to solve complex problems. This paper aims to analyze the most predominantly used bioinspired optimization techniques that have been used for stock market prediction and hence present a comparative
study between them.
